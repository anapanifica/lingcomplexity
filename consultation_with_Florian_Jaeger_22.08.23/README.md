find the formula which describes the slope of the interpolated curve
(read the article mentioned in the description of the function which makes interpolated curves in the package zipfR)
this formula contains a coefficient
the coefficient is constant and does not change with the corpus size
find standard deviation for that coefficient
compare coefficients (taking into account their sd) for different languages
run a Bayesian regression brm and include there the coefficients for 32 languages (ideally also their sd) and their elevations
